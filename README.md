We are interested in if and how  random sweepstakes and randomly occurring bottlenecks 
facilitate rapid adaptation as measured  through the probability of fixation of a beneficial type, 
and  the time to fixation conditional on fixation of the beneficial type.  Here we focus on single-locus models in 
either haploid or diploid populations.  For a diploid population one can  additionally investigate
how the various  dominance  configurations of the beneficial type affect the chance and time 
to fixation.

Random sweepstakes is one mechanism of generating sweepstakes reproduction in highly fecund populations.
In highly fecund populations individuals have the ability to produce enormous  numbers of potential offspring 
(juveniles), or at least on the order of the population size. However,  high fecundity by itself is not 
sufficient to generate sweepstakes reproduction, or highly skewed  individual recruitment success
(offspring number distribution).   What is required is a mechanism turning  high fecundity into skewed individual
recruitment success.   Random sweepstakes is one such mechanism.  In random sweepstakes,  Type III survivorship 
and the chance matching of reproduction with favorable environmental conditions  jointly form a mechanism turning 
high fecundity into sweepstakes reproduction.  

We model random sweepstakes through a heavy-tailed  distribution on the  number of juveniles produced by the individuals 
current in any given generation.  The juveniles inherit the type of the parent (we do not include mutation), or in the case 
of a diploid population we follow Mendel's laws.  The type of each  juvenile  affects the probability of it surviving, unless
 there was a bottleneck, and the  total number of juveniles does not exceed a fixed number, called the  carrying capacity. 
 In that case all the juveniles survive. Thus, we model a simple viability selection.
